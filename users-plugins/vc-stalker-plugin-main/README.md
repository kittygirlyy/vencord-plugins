# vc-stalker-plugin
## Is this done?

No, not all the features are completed yet, but it is currently in a usable state.

## What is this?

This is a custom plugin for Vencord that allows you to stalk users, it is very useful to tell if someone is ignoring you or see if they are talking to someone else.

## Why?

Because I get bored and am also slightly crazy.

## Features

- Notify you when a stalked user does any of the following actions
  - Sends a message in another channel
  - Edits a message in another channel
  - Deletes a message in another channel (requires [vc-message-logger-enhanced](https://github.com/Syncxv/vc-message-logger-enhanced/))
  - Starts typing in another channel
  - Updates their bio / profile picture / global name
  - Creates a thread
  - Updates their presence (status, rpc, etc...)
  - Joins a server you are in
  - Joins a voice chat in a channel you have access to.
